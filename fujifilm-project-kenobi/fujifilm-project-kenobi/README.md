## 2. Prerequisites

### 2.1 Certificate in AWS Certificate Manager and Registered Domain
The following instructions will help you create or import a certificate and set up a public domain using Amazon Route 53 if required.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/setup.html

### 2.2 An SSH key available for use with the windows instance
Follow the instructions below to create an SSH key in the region where the template will be deployed.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/create-key-pairs.html


## 3. How to use the CloudFormation templates

### Step-by-step instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local directory. 
2. Set up the underlying networking and directory services using the cloudformation template `templates/DPath_VPCs.yaml`. Customise the input parameters as necessary.
3. Once the template has been deployed, upload the file `userdata/webserver.txt` to the s3 bucket created by the template in point 2. This will provice with the networking and directory service required to set up all subsequent demo systems.
4. Deploy the demo application stack `templates/DPath_Demo_App.yaml` filling out the required parameters.
5. After the final template is deployed, you should be able to see the test web server through the URI you've selected.

## 4. Connect to Instance using SSM port forwarding

### 4.1 Install Session Manager Plug-in
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html
